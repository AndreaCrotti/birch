# Birch

This repository is part of the two part video tutorial on writing command line applications with Lumo, featured on [Lambda Island](https://lambdaisland.com)

[Part 1](https://lambdaisland.com/episodes/building-cli-apps-with-lumo-part-1) covers the basics, how to install lumo, how to create an executable script, and how to consume Node.js's built-in modules. [browse the resulting code](https://github.com/lambdaisland/birch/tree/ep29-end).

[Part 2](https://lambdaisland.com/episodes/building-cli-apps-with-lumo-part-2) covers how to release your script as an NPM module, and how to consume third party libraries from Clojars or NPM. [browse the resulting code](https://github.com/lambdaisland/birch/tree/ep30-end).

A re-implementation of the classic Unix command `tree` as a ClojureScript/Lumo
script.
